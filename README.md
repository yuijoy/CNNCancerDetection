CNN Cancer Detection

This project is part of a Kaggle competition focused on automatically identifying metastatic cancer in small image patches taken from larger digital pathology scans. The objective is to build a binary classifier to predict whether a given image patch contains cancerous tissue.

* Dataset: The dataset consists of image patches of size 96x96 pixels. 
* Training Set: Contains labeled images to train the model. 
* Test Set: Contains unlabeled images for which predictions are needed. 
* Class Distribution: The class labels indicate the presence (1) or absence (0) of cancer.
